Strategy explanation:

Monthly Returns Calculation: The strategy calculates the monthly returns for the consistent stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over the past ten years. 

Portfolio construction: 
- The portfolio is rebalanced regularly.
- Each month, the strategy chooses the best-performing equities based on their monthly returns.
- Initially, the portfolio includes the top six stocks.
- Every month, the strategy replaces the three worst-performing equities in the portfolio with the best-performing firms from the remaining universe.

Performance metrics: 
CAGR: Measures the portfolio's yearly growth rate.
Volatility: The annualized standard deviation of monthly returns.
Sharpe Ratio: Calculates risk-adjusted return while accounting for the risk-free rate.
Maximum Drawdown: Measures the greatest dip from peak to trough.

Reasons for outperformance:

Dynamic Adjustment: The technique modifies the portfolio composition by removing underperforming equities and adding high-performing ones. This ensures that the portfolio is always weighted toward stocks with significant momentum.

The strategy focuses on the top six performers each month, identifying equities with high upward momentum and potential for short-term profits.

Removing the worst-performing equities each month reduces downside risk and drawdowns, leading to a higher risk-adjusted return.

In conclusion, by dynamically altering its holdings depending on recent performance, the monthly portfolio rebalancing approach outperformed the DJIA index. The strategy outperformed in terms of risk-adjusted returns and CAGR by continuously eliminating underperforming companies and concentrating on top-performing stocks, as demonstrated by the Sharpe Ratio. The strategy's success demonstrates how well momentum-based investing and active portfolio management work to control risks and capture quick profits.
